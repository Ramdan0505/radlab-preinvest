I don’t have access to your case management system or its contents, so I can’t see the specific details for case `44bd0e9c-1a8c-4723-b422-35c0ab131c20`.

If you can paste in (or describe) the extraction log, workflow notes, or tool output for that case, I can:

- Identify and list the extraction steps that were actually performed.
- Group them by source (e.g., disk, memory, mobile, cloud).
- Note tools, modes (logical/physical), and any errors or re-runs.
- Produce a concise, step-by-step summary suitable for your case report.

Without that data, I can only give a generic DFIR extraction template, which likely won’t meet your needs.
