I don’t have direct access to your case management system or its contents, so I can’t look up case `2f9fb99c-2739-4b9b-9a15-07316d8a972f` or see what was actually done.

If you paste in the relevant case notes, acquisition logs, or tool output for that case, I can:

- Extract and condense the acquisition / extraction steps.
- Arrange them chronologically (e.g., identification → preservation → collection → verification).
- Normalize tool names, versions, hashes, and command lines into a clean summary suitable for reporting or chain‑of‑custody documentation.

If you prefer a template-style summary, here’s a concise DFIR extraction-steps outline you can adapt to that case:

1. **Preparation**
   - Identified target devices/media and scope.
   - Recorded system details (make/model, serial, OS, timestamps).

2. **Preservation**
   - Connected evidence via write-blocker (hardware/software as applicable).
   - Captured photographs and initial state (powered on/off, peripherals, network).

3. **Acquisition**
   - Performed bit-for-bit imaging of [device/media] using [tool, version].
   - Command/parameters: `[insert actual command line]`.
   - Destination: `[path/storage]` with read-only permissions set post-acquisition.

4. **Verification**
   - Generated cryptographic hashes (e.g., MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256) of source and image.
   - Verified hash matches to confirm image integrity.
   - Logged all acquisition metadata (date/time, operator, tool version, hashes).

5. **Post-Acquisition Handling**
   - Securely stored original media in evidence locker with updated chain-of-custody.
   - Mounted images read-only for analysis (e.g., via [tool/mount method]).

Share the raw notes or log snippets from that specific case and I’ll convert them into a precise, case-specific extraction-steps summary.
